        <h2 class="bylaw-header">Article I: Offices</h2>

        <h3>Section 1: Principal Office.</h3>

        <p>
          The principal office of the corporation shall be located in the
          Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other location designated by the
          Board of Directors.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 2: Registered Office.</h3>

          maintained in the State of North Carolina shall be at a location
          designated by the Board of Directions.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 3: Other Offices.</h3>

        <p>
          The corporation may have offices at such other places, either within
          or without the State of North Carolina or the Commonwealth of
          Massachusetts, as the Board of Directors may designate or as the
          affairs of the corporation may require from time to time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="bylaw-header">Article II: Board of Directors</h2>

        <h3>Section 1: General Powers.</h3>

        <p>
          The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by its
          Board of Directors.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 2: Number, Term and Qualifications.</h3>

        <p>
          The number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be
          at least three and not more than fifteen as may be fixed or changed
          from time to time, within the minimum and maximum, by the Board of
          Directors. Each director shall be elected for a maximum term of three
          years and until he or his successor is elected and qualifies for a
          new term. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes
          with staggered terms, with each class as nearly equal in number as
          may be. Accordingly, approximately one-third of the directors’ terms
          of office shall expire each year. Each director is eligible to apply
          and be re-elected to the board for additional three year terms. Any
          election to renew or replace a director whose term has expired shall
          be for a three-year term. Any person elected to replace a director
          who dies, resigns or is removed prior to the expiration of his term
          shall serve for the remainder of such director’s unexpired term.
          Directors need not be residents of the State of North Carolina.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 3: Elections.</h3>

        <p>
          The directors shall be elected by the vote of the directors then in
          office. Elections may occur via majority voting, plurality voting,
          approval voting, or preferential voting with single-transferable
          vote. Voting on all matters, including the election of Directors and
          officers, may be conducted by voice, ballot, mail, electronic mail,
          facsimile transmission, chat software, video conferencing, or other
          similar verifiable means. Proxy voting shall not be allowed. If any
          director so demands, the election of directors shall be by ballot.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 4: Removal.</h3>

        <p>
          Any director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the
          vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a
          quorum is present. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing,
          any director who fails to attend at least fifty percent (50%) of
          the meetings of the Board of Directors in any fiscal year shall be
          removed unless a majority of the directors present at a meeting at
          which a quorum is present shall vote to permit such director to
          complete the unexpired portion of his term as director.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 5: Vacancies.</h3>

        <p>
          Any vacancy occurring among the directors may be filled by the
          affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors even
          though less than a quorum or by the sole remaining director. A
          director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the
          unexpired term of his predecessor in office.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 6: Compensation.</h3>

        <p>
          Directors shall not be compensated for their services as such but
          may be reimbursed for any or all expenses incurred in attending
          regular and special meetings of the Board.
        </p>

        <h2 class="bylaw-header">Article III. Meetings of Directors</h2>

        <h3>Section 1: Regular Meetings.</h3>

        <p>
          A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held annually
          at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place
          as the Board may designate. In addition, the Board of Directors may
          provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within or without
          the State of North Carolina, for the holding of additional regular
          meetings.  Regular meetings may be held in person, or via video
          conference, phone, and/or email.
        </p>

        <p>
          Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at
          the request of the President or any two directors. Such a meeting
          may be held either within or without the State of North Carolina,
          as fixed by the person or persons calling the meeting. Special
          meetings may be held in person, or via video conference, phone,
          and/or email.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 3: Notice of Meetings.</h3>

        <p>
          Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without
          notice. The person or persons calling a special meeting of the Board
          of Directors shall, at least ten days prior to the meeting, give
          written notice thereof delivered personally or sent by mail,
          facsimile transmission or electronic mail to each director at his
          address as shown by the records of the corporation. If mailed, such
          notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United
          States mail in a sealed envelope so addressed with postage thereon
          prepaid. If sent by facsimile transmission or electronic mail, such
          notice shall be deemed delivered when confirmation of delivery to
          the designated number or mailbox is received. Such notice need not
          specify the purpose for which the meeting is called.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 4: Waiver of Notice.</h3>

        <p>
          Any director may waive notice of any meeting. The attendance by a
          director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
          meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express
          purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the
          meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 5: Quorum.</h3>

        <p>
          A majority of the members of the Board of Directors shall constitute
          a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board
          of Directors.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 6: Manner of Acting.</h3>

        <p>
          Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, the act of the
          majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is
          present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 7: Presumption of Assent.</h3>

        <p>
          A director of the corporation who is present at a meeting of the
          Board of Directors at which action on any corporate matter is taken
          shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his
          contrary vote is recorded or his dissent is otherwise entered in
          the minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file his written
          dissent to such action with the person acting as the secretary of
          the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such
          dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the corporation
          immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to
          dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such
          action.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 8: Informal Action by Directors.</h3>

        <p>
          Action taken by the directors without a meeting is nevertheless
          Board action if written consent to the action in question is
          approved by all of the directors, such approval may be evidenced
          by signature or electronic indicia of assent, and filed with the
          minutes of the proceedings of the Board, whether done before or
          after the action so taken.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 9: Committees of the Board.</h3>

        <p>
          The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the
          directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, may
          designate certain directors to constitute an Executive Committee
          and other committees, each of which, to the extent authorized by
          law and provided in such resolution, shall have and may exercise
          all of the authority of the Board of Directors in the management
          of the corporation. The designation of any committee and the
          delegation thereto of authority shall not operate to relieve the
          Board of Directors, or any member thereof, of any responsibility
          or liability imposed upon it or him by law.
        </p>

        <h3>Section 10: Advisory Board.</h3>

          directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, may

          The compensation of all officers of the corporation, if any, shall
          be fixed by the Board of Directors and no officer shall serve the

          Any officer or agent elected or appointed by the Board of Directors
          may be removed by the Board whenever in its judgment the best

          such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if
          any, of the person so removed.

          execution thereof shall be expressly delegated by the Board of
          Directors or by these bylaws to some other officer or agent of the
          corporation, or shall be required by law to be otherwise signed or
          executed; and in general he shall perform all duties incident to
