          vote of two-thirds at any regular or special meeting, by an
          affirmative vote of a majority at a meeting provided that at
          least ten days' notice is given of intention to determine a
          vacant board seat exists. Unless otherwise specified, a new
          vacancy is considered a board-elected seat. The new seat's term

        <p>
          The Executive Director should clearly communicate the timeline for
          receiving feedback regarding planned actions. Whenever possible,
          the Executive Director should defer action in response to a request
          by any two voting members of the Board of Directors to discuss and
          vote upon the planned action.

        <h2>5. Policies</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Whistleblower Policy</h3>

        <h4>5.1.1 Reporting Responsibility</h4>

        <p>
          It is the responsibility of all directors, officers and employees
          to report violations or suspected violations of the organization’s
          governance documents, policies and procedures, and state and federal
          law.
        </p>

        <h4>5.1.2 Confidentiality and No Retaliation</h4>

        <p>
          Violations or suspected violations may be submitted on a confidential
          basis or may be submitted anonymously. Reports will be kept
          confidential to the extent possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          No director, officer or employee who in good faith reports any such
          violation shall suffer harassment, retaliation or adverse employment
          consequence. An employee who retaliates against someone who has
          reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to
          and including termination of employment. This policy is intended to
          encourage and enable employees and others to raise serious concerns
          within the organization prior to seeking resolution outside the
          organization.
        </p>

        <h4>5.1.3 Reporting Violations</h4>

        <p>
          Staff are encouraged to share their questions, concerns, suggestions
          or complaints with a supervisor, if they are comfortable doing so.
          If you are uncomfortable with doing so, or are not satisfied with
          the response, you may report to other management.
        </p>

        <p>
          Supervisors and managers are required to report suspected violations
          to a voting member of the Board of Directors. For suspected fraud,
          or when you are not satisfied or uncomfortable with contacting a
          supervisor or management, you may contact a Director directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyone filing a complaint concerning a violation or suspected
          violation must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds
          for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation of
          the organization’s governance documents, policies and procedures,
          and state and federal law. Allegations that prove to be
          unsubstantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or
          knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary
          offense.
        </p>

        <h4>5.1.4 Handling Reports</h4>

        <p>
          The Director is responsible for investigating and resolving all
          reported complaints and allegations and, at his discretion, shall
          advise the rest of the Board of Directors.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Director should notify the sender and acknowledge receipt of
          the reported violation or suspected violation. Reports should be
          promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action will be
          taken if warranted by the investigation.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>

        <p>
          The organization strongly disapproves of and does not tolerate
          harassment of any kind on the basis of gender, gender identity,
          gender expression, sexual orientation, race, national origin,
          disability, age or religion. All employees have the unconditional
          right to work in an environment free from harassment. Whether
          verbal or physical or whether arising in the work environment,
          during work assignments out of the office, on a business trip, or
          at organization-sponsored social functions, harassment is illegal
          and has no legitimate business purpose. Any violation of this
          policy will result in discipline and may cause you to lose your
          job. In addition, this policy prohibits any retaliation against an
          employee who registers an harassment complaint in good faith, who
          opposes harassment or who participates in the complaint process.
        </p>

        <p>
          The organization is committed to the prompt, confidential
          investigation of any harassment complaint, no matter who the
          offender might be, and all employees should feel comfortable in
          reporting any violation of this policy according to the procedures
          described by the Whistleblower Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Conflict of Interest Policy</h3>

        <h4>5.3.1 Duty to disclose</h4>

        <p>
          Directors, officers, and employees of Open Humans Foundation have
          a duty to disclose potential conflicts of interest. Conflicts of
          interest include, but are not limited to, any existing or potential
          financial relationships that involve ownership, investment interest,
          and/or receipt of compensations with respect to any entity with
          which the organization has a financial transaction or ongoing
          arrangement.
        </p>

        <h4>5.3.2 Determining if a conflict exists</h4>

        <p>
          To determine whether a reported relationship represents a conflict
          of interest, the individual(s) involved should leave any meeting
          where the issue is to be discussed. The remaining disinterested
          governing board or committee meeting members should discuss and
          decide whether a conflict of interest exists.
        </p>

        <h4>5.3.3 Resolving conflict of interest</h4>

        <p>
          If a conflict of interest is determined to exist, it should be
          resolved in the following manner:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A supervisor, manager, or chair of a meeting or committee may,
            if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to
            investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or
            arrangement.
          </li>
          <li>
            The supervisor, manager, board, or committee should determine
            whether the organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a
            more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or
            entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            If alternative is not reasonably possible that better avoids
            conflict of interest, the supervisor, manager, or a majority of
            the disinterested members of the board or committee may decide
            whether the transaction is in the organization's best interest,
            fair, and reasonable, and whether to enter into the transaction
            or arrangement.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5.3.4 Violations</h4>

        <p>
          If the supervisor, manager, board, or committee has reasonable
          cause to believe an individual has failed to disclose actual or
          possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the individual of
          the basis for such belief and give the individual an opportunity
          to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
        </p>

        <p>
          If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further
          investigation as warranted, the supervisor, manager, board, or
          committee determines that the individual has failed to disclose
          an actual or possible conflict of interest, they shall take
          appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
        </p>

        <h4>5.3.4 Compensation and voting</h4>

        <p>
          If a voting member of the Board of Directors, or of a committee
          whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters, receives
          compensation from the organization for services, they are precluded
          from voting on matters pertaining to their own compensation. They
          are, however, permitted to provide information to the board or
          committee regarding their compensation.

        <h3>5.4 Travel Policy</h3>

        <h4>5.4.1 Air travel</h4>

        <p>
          Travelers are expected to book the lowest-priced, non-stop
          economy-class airfare available.
        </p>

        <h4>5.4.2 Ground travel</h4>

        <p>
          Travelers are expected to use the most economical mode of
          transportation appropriate for their needs, including public
          transportation, trains, taxis, and similar services. Car rental
          should be used only when it is the most cost-effective or
          practical means of travel. Travelers must purchase appropriate
          insurance coverage.
        </p>

        <h4>5.4.3 Lodging</h4>

        <p>
          Lodging that is reimbursed by the organization should be an
          economical option made at the discretion of the traveler.
          Travelers should not purchase lodging more expensive than
          standard, single-occupancy rooms.
        </p>

        <h4>5.4.4 Reporting for reimbursement</h4>

        <p>
          When seeking reimbursement for travel related to services
          provided to the organization, a traveler should include the
          following information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Business connection.</u> Describe the thing being
            reimbursed (e.g. travel, lodging, meal), who was involved,
            where and when it occurred, and how it relates to organization
            activities. Spouses and family members are not covered unless
            there is a business purpose for their presence on the trip.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Receipts.</u> Reimbursements for greater than $75 must be
            accompanied by receipts. If a receipt is missing, a traveler
            must sign a statement affirming the expenses incurred as
            described.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Signature.</u> The reimbursee must sign the reimbursement
            request. This request should affirm that expenses have not been
            and will not be submitted again for any repeat reimbursement
            within the organization or elsewhere.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When requested, Open Humans Foundation will cover travel costs
          for officers and board members to participate in organization
          business.
        </p>

        <h4>5.4.5 Tips and elective fees</h4>

        <p>
          The organization will not reimburse for tips beyond 15%. Some
          hotels, airlines and other vendors ask customers to pay for
          “elective fees” such as carbon offset credits, donations to
          charities, etc. Travelers may pay for these fees with personal
          funds, but should not submit them for reimbursement.
