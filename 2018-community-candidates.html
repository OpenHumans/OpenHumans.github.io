          <h4>Public statement</h4>
          <p>
            I am head of quantified biology at Veritas Genetics, the first
            company to introduce whole genome sequencing and interpretation to
            consumers and their physicians for under $1,000. My current
            research is focused on the delivery of real-time, biomedical
            insights from massive data sets, spanning millions of individuals
            across collaborating organizations, eventually encompassing
            exabytes of data. I am also a co-founder of the Harvard Personal
            Genome Project.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hope is that Open Humans becomes a central, global hub for
            participatory research and participant led data sharing much as
            Wikipedia has become a hub for sharing facts. Specifically, I will
            use my relationships with the Global Alliance for Genomics and
            Health (GA4GH), the NIH data commons pilot, the NIST "Genome In a
            Bottle" reference material consortium, and the global Personal
            Genome Project (PGP) organizations to further the integration of
            Open Humans with other local, national and international biomedical
            data sharing efforts.

            I have worked with Mad Price Ball as an informal adviser on Open
            Humans since its inception.  (We are both Harvard Biophysics and
            George Church lab alum.)   I also helped create the link between
            Harvard PGP and Open Humans that allows Harvard PGP participants
            to export data to OH and have used this link to export my own data.
            Currently, I am deeply involved in standards efforts that will
            enable many more projects to empower and encourage their
            participants to share their data via OH cf. GA4GH.

          <p>
            My life's mission is to accelerate the progress of science by
            making as much data accessible to as many researchers as possible.
            Most of my work has focused on brain imaging data. I built a
            platform for sharing results of neuroimaging experiments
            (<a href="https://NeuroVault.org">https://NeuroVault.org</a>), as
            well as one for sharing raw neuroimaging data
            (<a href="https://OpenNeuro.org">https://OpenNeuro.org</a> - formerly known as
            OpenfMRI). I have also been promoting ethical data sharing by
            providing ready to use text for participant content forms
            (<a href="http://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ultimate.html">http://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ultimate.html</a>).
            I would work with the Open Humans Foundation to help integrate it
            with existing open neuroimaging databases and getting their
            participants involved in additional follow-up data collection
            via the Open Humans platform.

          <h4>Public statement</h4>
          <p>
            I am passionate about open source and open science efforts.
            I'm one of the creators and the first users of an open source
            artificial pancreas (e.g. hybrid closed loop) system to make
            life with type 1 diabetes easier. My skillset ranges from
            non-traditional technical skills to communication and
            strategy. I’m dedicated to taking what we’ve learned in the
            diabetes community &amp; sharing these lessons learned with
            all communities. To that end, I’m also a RWJF grant-funded
            principal investigator, studying the processes of patient-driven
            and patient-led innovation research, with goals around scaling
            effective processes and collaborations between traditional and
            'new' stakeholders. I’ve used OpenHumans for ~2 years now, and
            believe it plays an integral role in enabling individuals to
            share data and facilitate new research efforts. My vision is to
            help support and scale the organization to continue to meet the
            needs of these new stakeholders and communities.

            Commons, OpenAPS Data Commons) and serve as the volunteer
            community project administrator. I work to facilitate new
            research efforts to analyze diabetes data with dozens of
            researchers as a result of Open Humans data being available.
            I developed several open source scripts and tools to help
            facilitate researchers to be able to use rich, complex data
            sets donated by our communities (several scripts are
            multipurpose and can be used with other Open Humans data as

          <h4>Public statement</h4>
          <p>
            My passion for sharing science with the public started in graduate
            school, when I realized that scientists do a bad job of explaining
            their work to the broader community. This is critical — public
            perception of science has downstream effects on funding. A major
            roadblock is a misunderstanding of the scientific process and
            timeline. Citizen science projects help fill this knowledge gap by
            giving people the opportunity to contribute to science and
            experience it first hand. One of my most fulfilling experiences
            was managing the American Gut Project, which is part of Open
            Humans. Open Humans encourages people to support citizen science,
            and the dataset integration it promotes is critical for making
            precision medicine a reality in healthcare. My vision for Open
            Humans includes establishing educational efforts such as more
            regular and varied blog posts, short video blogs, and online
            courses — including a hands-on course on how to interpret
            scientific papers.

          <h4>Contributions to Open Humans</h4>
          <p>
            One way I've contributed to Open Humans was helping facilitate the
            integration of the American Gut Project dataset into the Open
            Humans system by advising and guiding the American Gut team of
            developers that contributed to the code, and by communicating with
            the developers on the Open Humans side when necessary.
            I've participated in the GET Conference and GET Labs, representing
            American Gut, and I actively send people to Open Humans on a
            regular basis. I've also integrated my own datasets into Open
            Humans and have made them public for users.

          <h4>Public statement</h4>
          <p>
            I have always had a passion for science, especially genetics. I
            ended up in software instead, but have continued to follow the
            field as an adult. I joined the Personal Genome Project in January
            2011, and have been an activate participant ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            I organized and ran the PGP Participant's Forum. I have also
            created several tools for the Open Humans API, including the
            HealthKit Uploader app.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a second career as a freelance writer. I have written
            for publications such as the Christian Science Monitor, and have
            also written 3 books on software development. I also am the
            president and chairman of the board of a 501(c)3 public charity
            that has raised over $250,000 for cancer research, among other
            causes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think that I could leverage both my experience in journalism and
            in fundraising to assist the board in it's duties. I would like to
            see OH work to expand the number of participants with active
            datasets so that the statistical power of the data would be
            increased.

            date peer reviewed proceedings and journals in computer science,
            human-computer interaction and health informatics. She is a (co)-PI
            in several European, Swiss and Stanford Medicine projects. The
            vision for Open Humans is to enable individual’s short-term
            behavior and long-term QoL assessment and improvement based on the
            crowdsourced efforts of the donors, social and behavioral, as well
            as data scientists and practitioners leveraging the results for
            better QoL-enabling services.

            at the OH platform.

          <h4>Public statement</h4>
          <p>
            For decades, I’ve managed consumer-focused software products at
            places like Apple, Microsoft, and numerous startups because I
            believe technology is a great equalizer, transforming society by
            putting powerful computing tools within the reach of everyone. An
            early and active fan of OpenHumans, I think science too can be
            transformed if we make personal health and self-tracking data
            openly accessible to all curious people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like most OpenHumans users, my background is outside the world of
            professional science or academia.  As a former product developer,
            big company exec, and entrepreneur, I want OpenHumans to appeal to
            all ranges of expertise, in every part of the world, because the
            ability to do science shouldn’t depend on your background or your
            current skill level.  To do this, I’d like to help OpenHumans
            (1) improve its visibility through world-class marketing and
            promotion, (2) expand internationally and (3) remain the best
            place for sharing, exploring, and analyzing humans.

          <h4>Contributions to Open Humans</h4>
          <p>
            As one of the first OpenHumans users, I’ve shared my data from
            uBiome, Healthkit, Runkeeper, Gencove and others. I also had the
            privilege (and excitement!) to participate in at least one project
            (by a Swiss researcher who wanted to use my microbiome data for a
            study).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also just a sincere fan of the work OpenHumans does, so I
            regularly tweet/retweet new developments, encourage my friends to
            sign up, and speak about the organization whenever I have the
            chance at QS forums, biohacking meetups and other places with
            friendly people.
          </p>
          <h4>Competing Interests Statement</h4>
          <p>
            None. I am currently US CEO of a China-based company,
            http://airdoc.com that uses hospital-collected data to build deep
            learning AI models. I would love to use my relationships with Asia
            to help OpenHumans expand, but I'm not involved with anything
            directly or indirectly competitive.
